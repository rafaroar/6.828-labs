1. x is uintptr_t
2. table:

Entry   BVA         Points to
1023    ?           page table for top 4MB of phys mem
1022    ?           ?
.       ?           ?
.       ?           ?
.       ?           ?
2       0x00800000  ?
1       0x00400000  ?
0       0x00000000  -

3. Access rights are placed so that the users cannot access the kernel space. User programs use virtual memory addresses that are reallocated as physical addresses in the user space.

4. Number of npages which is
	npages_basemem = (nvram_read(NVRAM_BASELO) * 1024) / PGSIZE
if there is no extended memory or
	npages_extmem = (nvram_read(NVRAM_EXTLO) * 1024) / PGSIZE
if there's extended memory

5. Space overhead

6. When we are over 4 MB. We can continue this because addresses over KERNBASE, let's say in [KERNBASE, KERNBASE + 4MB) are mapped to the corresponding physical address in [0, 4MB) by subtracting KERNBASE. We choose 4MB because that's how much we can map with one page table and it's enough to get us through early boot.
