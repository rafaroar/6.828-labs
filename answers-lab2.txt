1. x is uintptr_t
2. table:

Entry   BVA         Points to
1023    0xFFC00000  page table for top 4MB of phys mem
1022    0xFF800000  page table for the next 4MB of phys mem
960     0xF0000000  page table for bottom 4MB of phys mem
959     0xEFFF8000  CPU kernel stack
956     0xEF000000  user pages
2       0x00800000  ?
1       0x00400000  ?
0       0x00000000  -

3. Access rights are placed so that the users cannot access the kernel space. User programs use virtual memory addresses that are reallocated as physical addresses in the user space.

4. Number of npages which is
	npages_basemem = (nvram_read(NVRAM_BASELO) * 1024) / PGSIZE
if there is no extended memory or
	npages_extmem = (nvram_read(NVRAM_EXTLO) * 1024) / PGSIZE
if there's extended memory

5. Space overhead:
2^32 / 2^12 = 2^20 pages. 

6. When we are over 4 MB. We can continue this because addresses over KERNBASE, let's say in [KERNBASE, KERNBASE + 4MB) are mapped to the corresponding physical address in [0, 4MB) by subtracting KERNBASE. We choose 4MB because that's how much we can map with one page table and it's enough to get us through early boot.
